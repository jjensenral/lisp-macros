# Intro to Emacs and Common Lisp Macros

Talk given to UKRSE Emacs channel 11 June 2021.

While this does not aim to teach macros, it does aim to give an overview of an estimated one third of the topic (the first one third!)
(The remaining two thirds are listed on the last slide)

Some of the slides come out a bit wonky when compiled but there wasn't time to figure out how to fix that.
